## SoundCloud Feed Cleaner
#### What is it and what does it do?
It's an extenstion for Google Chrome that adds an extra 'Uploads Only' tab to your SoundCloud stream page. SoundCloud Feed Cleaner creates an additional tab in your soundcloud feed called 'Uploads Only'. This tab filters your stream by hiding all reposts (unless the repost was of a remix or promotion on another channel) and just displays each artist's own creations.
