## SoundCloud Feed Cleaner
What is it and what does it do? 

It's an Extension for Google Chrome and it removes reposts from soundcloud.com/stream

What are reposts? 

Reposts are the 'shares'/clutter that often get in the way of enjoying your music.

SoundCloud Feed Cleaner creates an additional tab in your soundcloud feed called 'Uploads Only'.
This tab filters your stream by hiding all reposts (unless the repost was of a remix or promotion on another channel) and just displaying an artist's own creations.

Why should I want this?

Chances are, if you have found this, you know exactly why.
If you still need convincing, are you sick of scrolling through hundrends of unwanted songs on Soundcloud?
Do you ever dream of just listenting to the artists that you really care about?
